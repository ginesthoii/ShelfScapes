#  Shelfscapes

**Shelfscapes** is a creative engineering + maker project:  
a collection of miniature “book nooks” (dioramas built to fit between books on a shelf).  
Each nook recreates an immersive world — from Tolkien’s Middle-earth to Harry Potter,  
from Game of Thrones to original designs.  

This repo serves as a portfolio for:
- **Design & documentation** — CAD, sketches, textures, and assembly steps.
- **Electronics & security-minded builds** — LED wiring, Arduino/ESP code, safe power layouts.
- **Creative experimentation** — structured project folders, version control, reproducibility.

 Organized into:
- `/nooks/` — Polished fandom-inspired builds.
- `/readiculous/` — Experimental or humorous nooks.
- `/_shared/` — Reusable assets (textures, electronics, STL components).
